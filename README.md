# bootstrap-challenge

Bootstrap challenge/task to test your Bootstrap layout skills.

Using only Boostrap and the two css clases in the boostrap_task.html file 
get to the mockups shown in desktop_view and mobile_view.

Result should be one file which should be responsive using nothing but Boostrap.

# Getting Started
Simply checkout, take a look at the mocks and start editing the boostrap_task.html file.

# Don't peak
Try and get as much of it done as possible before you check your attempt against boostrap_complete.html
